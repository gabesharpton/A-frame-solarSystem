# A-frame-solarSystem
A repo for me to test out using A-Frame to build a VR Solar System

I found the project really fun working with a vr enviornment. I mostly tested it out on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) and use A-Frame to code. While this all used things out of the box I got a good understanding of positioning and radius in the VR enviornment!
